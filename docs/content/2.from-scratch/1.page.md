# Display page data
By default Nuxt creates basic project structure where you can find `app.vue` file. 

Remove `<NuxtWelcome/>` component there and put `<NuxtPage>` to display page data fetched from TYPO3 API.

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <NuxtPage/>
</template>
```

That's it. You should be able to see the page content. 
Let's move on to display navigation.
