# Override T3 components

To render all pages and their content elements we use [`Dynamic Components`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components#dynamic-components){:target="_blank"} and `resolveComponent` method what means we use them as global components. All components are loaded as lazy components.

To override module components you have to register your content elements as global also. 

Nuxt by default register all components as global when you put them in `components/global` directory, but you can configure it - it's up to you how you structure your components.

## Add your components directory

Use [`components`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config#components){:target="_blank"} config to register your directory with global components.

Edit `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  components: {
    dirs: [
      {
        path: '@/components/T3',
        global: true
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

Then you can save your content elements as `components/T3/T3CeText.vue`.

### Provide prefix
You can also configure prefix for all T3 components:


```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  components: {
    dirs: [
      {
        path: '@/components/T3',
        global: true,
        prefix: 'T3'
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

Then you can save your content elements as `components/T3/CeText.vue`.
